      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world of fast-paced software development, efficient deployment of applications has become more critical than ever. Containerization has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications, making it easier to deploy them consistently across different environments.
In this blog post, we will explore containerizing a simple Node.js weather application GITHUB that displays weather data from any given location, and then with this done proceed to automate its deployment using a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.</description>

This is an extremely simple web application that uses the home.</description>

      <description>I recently got my hands on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GBs of RAM for a decently reasonable price. I took the bullet on it to make it my small home server for the next few months since I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with Linux more and more every day.
Raspberry Pi A raspberry Pi is a minicomputer the amount of stuff this little thing can achieve is impressive. I have been having my eyes on these micro machines for a while so I was super excited to get a hold of one and make it my home server.</description>
